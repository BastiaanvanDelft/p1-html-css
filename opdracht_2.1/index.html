    <h2>How did i get into counter strike</h2>
    <h3>I have over 1500 hours on counter strike. But this all had to start somewhere. I started the day it went free to play. I enjoy the game's fast gameplay but the strategic/teamwork part too. I really enjoy playing this game with friends. I am currently in a team with a few friends and we play the game at a competitive level. </h3>
